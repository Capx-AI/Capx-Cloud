They review evidence and can either confirm or veto slashing requests, ensuring fairness and preventing unwarranted asset seizure. This reinforces trust in the system and encourages adherence to protocol rules.

The integration of vaults, operators, and resolvers through Symbiotic provides Capx Cloud with a flexible and adaptable foundation for trust-minimized infrastructure. This combination balances economic incentives, technical reliability, and fair adjudication, ensuring the system's stability and preventing any single entity from undermining it.

## **Roles and Responsibilities within the Capx Cloud Ecosystem**

Capx Cloud is designed as an interconnected ecosystem where each role—Performer Nodes, Attestor Nodes, Operators, Delegators, and Resolvers—collaborates to provide reliable, secure, and efficient decentralized services. These roles are interdependent, with each participant contributing unique expertise to maintain network integrity and scalability.

### **Performer Node**

Performer Nodes are the engine of the Capx Cloud network, responsible for executing the core AI computations and tasks submitted by users. These nodes form the foundation of the decentralized infrastructure, ensuring tasks are processed efficiently, reliably, and at scale. Their role is vital for supporting AI-driven applications and other AI-based operations.

When a user submits a task—such as running an AI model, processing data, or performing complex calculations—the Performer Node undertakes the execution.

**Key Responsibilities:**

*   **Task Execution:** Upon receiving a task, the Performer Node utilizes its computational resources to process and complete the task efficiently.
*   **Proof of Task Generation:** After completing the task, the node generates a cryptographic proof, known as the Proof of Task, which serves as verifiable evidence of the task's execution.
*   **Result Dissemination:** The Performer Node then broadcasts the task results and the Proof of Task to the network, ensuring transparency and enabling subsequent validation.

**Importance in the Network:**

The efficiency and reliability of Performer Nodes are crucial, as they directly impact the network's ability to handle complex computations and deliver timely results to users. Performer Nodes regularly communicate with other components in the Capx Cloud, particularly Attestor Nodes, to ensure the integrity of their output. This continuous verification cycle establishes trust and minimizes the risk of fraudulent or incorrect task execution.

### **Attestor Node**

Attestor Nodes serve as the Capx Cloud’s quality assurance mechanism, validating tasks executed by Performer Nodes. Their primary objective is to ensure that all computations meet the network’s predefined standards for accuracy and reliability. This process strengthens trust and prevents tampering or dishonesty within the network.

**Key Responsibilities:**

*   **Validation Process:** Upon receiving the Proof of Task and associated results from a Performer Node, Attestor Nodes independently verify the accuracy and legitimacy of the execution.
*   **Consensus Mechanism:** Attestor Nodes participate in a consensus protocol, where they cast votes on the validity of each task. A task is approved if a supermajority (typically two-thirds) of Attestor Nodes confirm its validity.
*   **Enforcement of Penalties:** If a significant portion of Attestor Nodes (e.g., more than one-third) deems a task invalid, the network enforces penalties, such as slashing, against the responsible Performer Node to uphold network integrity.

**Importance in the Network:**

By validating tasks, Attestor Nodes ensure that only accurate and trustworthy computations are accepted, preventing fraudulent or erroneous outputs. Their role is essential for maintaining the network's credibility and ensuring that users can trust the results produced by the Capx Cloud.

### **Operator**

Operators are the custodians of the Capx Cloud network, managing the infrastructure that keeps everything running smoothly Their responsibilities extend across multiple layers of the network, ensuring the stability, scalability, and security of decentralized services. Operators play a crucial role in maintaining node uptime, managing upgrades, and safeguarding the infrastructure against threats.

**Operators who have opted-in into the Capx Cloud Network**

*   P2P
*   Luganodes
*   Kiln
*   PierTwo
*   Alchemy
*   Node Monster
*   Certik
*   Block & Bones
*   and many more..

**Key Responsibilities:**

*   **Infrastructure Management:** Operators oversee the setup, configuration, and maintenance of nodes, ensuring optimal performance and minimal downtime.

*   **Governance Participation:** Operators engage in the network's governance processes, contributing to decision-making on protocol upgrades, policy changes, and other critical matters.

Through the Symbiotic protocol, operators can accept stakes from diverse partners via unified vaults. This system enables operators to run a single infrastructure for multiple stakeholders without the complexity of separate setups. By doing so, operators improve resource efficiency while broadening access to network services for stakers and users alike.

### **Delegator**

Delegators are crucial contributors to the Capx Cloud’s security and stability. Rather than directly operating nodes, they delegate their staked assets to trusted operators, thereby supporting network infrastructure while earning rewards for their participation. Delegators play a vital role in decentralizing the network by distributing stake among various operators.

**Key Responsibilities:**

*   **Operator Selection:** Delegators carefully choose reputable Operators based on performance metrics, reliability, and trustworthiness.
*   **Stake Delegation:** They allocate their assets to selected Operators, thereby enhancing the Operators' capacity to manage more tasks and secure the network.
*   **Governance Participation:** Delegators engage in voting processes, influencing decisions on network policies, upgrades, and other governance matters.

**Importance in the Network:**

Delegation lowers the barrier to entry for those who wish to support decentralized infrastructure without managing technical operations. Through their contributions, Delegators enhance the network’s economic security, allowing it to scale while maintaining decentralization and resilience.

### **Resolvers**

Resolvers are specialized entities responsible for resolving disputes within the Capx Cloud network. They serve as arbiters, handling disputes and overseeing slashing incidents—penalties imposed for malicious or faulty behavior when a Performer Node fails to meet task execution standards. Resolvers provide an impartial mechanism for reviewing these incidents to ensure that penalties are applied fairly and in accordance with network policies.

**Key Responsibilities:**

*   **Dispute Resolution:** Resolvers review conflicts arising from task executions, validations, or other network activities, providing impartial judgments.
*   **Slashing Oversight:** They assess slashing incidents to confirm that penalties are warranted and executed fairly.
*   **Policy Enforcement:** Resolvers ensure that all actions taken within the network adhere to established rules and guidelines, maintaining fairness and transparency.

Resolvers operate under predefined agreements between networks and vaults. Depending on the network’s risk tolerance, multiple resolvers may collaborate to reach a consensus before approving or vetoing a slashing event. This arrangement provides additional security guarantees for stakeholders, as decisions are made transparently and through a decentralized process.

**Importance in the Network:**

By providing a structured mechanism for dispute resolution and penalty enforcement, Resolvers uphold the network. Allowing for flexible, scalable governance structures tailored to the needs of different protocols within the Capx Cloud ecosystem.
